    In 2004, Manjula produced his next film, Naani, directed by S. J. Surya co-starring Amisha Patel. While its
    simultaneously shot Tamil version New featuring a different cast proved to be commercially successful, Naani flopped
    at the box office.He received his third Nandi Special Jury Award for his performance in his next film, Arjun,
    directed by Gunasekhar and produced by Ramesh. The film released on 18 August 2004 and was successful at the
    box-office. The film was screened at the <strike>International Film Festival</strike> of India in the mainstream section. This
    was Keerthi Reddy's final acting performance prior to her retirement from the film industry. He chose to act in
    Trivikram Srinivas's Athadu (2005), co-starring <u>Trisha Krishnan</u>, whose script had been approved back in 2002 before
    the production of Naani and Arjun had begun. It emerged as one of the highest-grossing films of the
    year. The film proved to be a major boost for Babu's career as he received his fourth nomination for the
    Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu, in addition to fetching his second Nandi Award for Best Actor for his
    performance in the role of a hired assassin. Idlebrain.com gave it a rating of 3.25/5 and mentioned Mahesh Babu
    is stylish and brilliant as professional killer.[42]Cinegoer.net gave a review stating, "True the film gives an
    image of a Hollywood base for the drama. Even the taking, screenplay structure and execution of scenes, less talk
    and more action.

    He then collaborated with <u>Puri Jagannadh</u> in 2006 for the film Pokiri opposite Ileana D'Cruz, which was jointly
    produced by Jagannadh and Manjula. He received high praise for his performance, with Y. Sunita Chowdary of The
    Hindu opining that "Mahesh's understated performance in Pokiri allows him effortlessly to reclaim the title of a
    star, overshadowing his questionable career choices of late".He won his second Filmfare Award for Best Actor –
    Telugu for his performance in the film. That same year, his next film,<u> Sainikudu</u>, was released. A critic
    from Rediff.com wrote that "Nonetheless, Sainikudu can be watched at least for its premise of letting the warrior in
    each individual surface, and the fact that it is done with the idea of motivating people to do something for their
    fellow humans".
