// Create a program that stores your name, age, and college name in variables and prints them.

// Write a program to calculate:

// Area of a rectangle (length × breadth)

// Area of a circle (π × r × r)

// Take two numbers x = 15 and y = 4, and print:

// Sum, Difference, Product, Division, Modulus

// Create a program that checks:

// If age ≥ 18 → print "You are eligible to vote"

// Else → "You are not eligible to vote"
